Reliability theory is a branch of statistics and engineering that focuses on the study of the reliability and maintainability of complex systems. It involves the analysis and prediction of the probability that a system, component, or process will operate correctly for a given period of time under specific conditions. The goal of reliability theory is to provide tools and methods for designing and testing systems to ensure their reliability, safety, and efficiency. This theory is applicable in various industries such as aerospace, automotive, manufacturing, healthcare, telecommunications, and many more.
