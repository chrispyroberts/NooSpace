Given a [[Random Variable]] $X$, its cumulative distribution function (CDF) is defined by: $$F_{X}:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}, F_{X}(x)=P_{X}((-\infty, x])=\mathbb{P}(X\le x)=\mathbb{P}(\{s\in S|X(s)\le x\})$$
A CDF measure the probability that a random variable will fall below a given point $x$. Such probabilities will arise frequently, which is the purpose of this notation.
