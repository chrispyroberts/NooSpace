1.  Mindful breathing: Take a few minutes to focus your attention on your breath. Pay attention to the sensation of the breath as it enters and leaves your body. If your mind starts to wander, gently bring your focus back to your breath without judgment.

2.  Body scan: Close your eyes and bring your attention to different parts of your body, starting from your toes and gradually moving upward. Notice any sensations, tensions, or areas of relaxation without trying to change anything. This practice helps to cultivate body awareness and release tension.

3.  Mindful observation: Choose an object in your environment, such as a flower or a piece of artwork. Take a few minutes to observe it fully, paying attention to its colors, shapes, textures, and any other details. Engage your senses and be fully present in the moment, without getting caught up in thoughts or judgments.

4.  Mindful walking: Engage in walking meditation by focusing on the sensations of walking. Pay attention to the movement of your feet, the feeling of the ground beneath you, and the rhythm of your steps. If your mind wanders, gently bring your attention back to the act of walking.

5.  Mindful eating: Slow down and savor each bite of your meal. Pay attention to the flavors, textures, and smells. Notice the sensations of chewing and swallowing. Be fully present and engage your senses in the experience of eating.
