[[Proof Tree for Irrationality of 2.canvas|Proof Tree for Irrationality of 2]]

Assume for indrect argumentation that $\sqrt 2$ is rational, that is,
$$\frac{x}{y}=\sqrt2$$
Without loss of generality, we can assume that $x$ and $y$ do not have a common divisor.
Now we shall prove that both $x$ and $y$ must be even, and therefore have a common divisor, and thus a condtradiction.

<u>Step 1</u>
$$ \frac{x}{y}=\sqrt2$$
By squaring both sides we have:
$$\frac{x^2}{y^2}=2$$
By elementary arithmetic we obtain:
$$ x^{2}= 2y^2$$
This implies that both $x$ and $x^2$ are even.

<u>Step 2</u>
From **Step 1** we know that x is even, thus there is some $z$ such that:
$$ x=2x$$
Substituting $2z$ for $x$ yields
$$(2z)^2=2y^2$$
Expanding the left-hand size gives the following:
$$4z^2=2y^2$$
Dividing both sides by 2, we obtain:
$$2z^2=y^2$$
This justifies, as in Step 1, the conclusion that both $y$ and $y^2$ are even.

Thus, we have contradicted our assumption that $x$ anmd $y$ are relatively prime, as both $x$ and $y$ are divisible by 2.
