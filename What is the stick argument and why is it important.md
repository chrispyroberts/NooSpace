The "stick argument" is an example that demonstrates that form is all that matters when it comes to the validity of arguments. It convinced medieval logicians that contradictions allow us to infer any statement whatsoever, regardless of the subject matter of the contradiction. The argument involves the following contradiction: "Socrates exists and Socrates does not exist," with the conclusion being "The stick is standing in the corner." The argument shows that the content of statements is of no consequence for (logical) arguments, and only the logical form of the statements involved matters.
