Non-self-membership: $x\notin x$

Let $R = \{x : x\notin x \}$

Now consider the following:

$$R\in R \implies R\notin R$$ 
$$R\notin R \implies R\in R$$
In both cases we have a contradiction. This means $R$ cannot be a set. 

Yet the Unrestricted Comphrehension Principle guarantees $R$ exists as a set
$$\text{For any property } \psi \text{, the set of objects with property } \psi \text{ exists.}$$
This leads us to believe the principle must be flawed.
