**[[What are the two criteria for a good argument]]**

**[[What is the difference between deductive and inductive logic]]**

##### Argument 1
-   If you don't remember to keep the lid on a teapot when you are finished using it, cats are likely to get into the teapot and make a mess.
-   ∴ You should remember to keep the lid on a teapot when you are finished using it.


##### Argument 2
-   Cats don't like to get wet, and teapots are frequently filled with tea.
-   Immersing a cat in tea is guaranteed to get the cat wet.
-   ∴ Cats are not likely to get into teapots.

##### Argument 3
-   Either the cat got into the teapot and made a mess, or the hamster did.
-   If the cat got into the teapot, it would be damp and smell like tea.
-   The cat is neither damp, nor does it smell like tea.

-   ∴ The hamster got into the teapot and made a mess.
