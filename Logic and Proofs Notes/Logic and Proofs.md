## Course Overview

This course is focused on the understanding and the discovery of proofs. Proofs are a distinctive form of rigorour arguemennts used in mathematics. they start out, as in [[Euclid's Elements]], from first principles and proceed by logical steps from them, and them alone, to establish theorems. 

### Classical Roots and Modern Impact | A Short Introduction

Other parts of mathematics also contain proofs. 

- Newtonian Mechanics
- [[Probability Theory]]
- Game Theory
- Measurement Theory

Logic provides steps of correct, valid reasoning, and these steps guarantee, that if their assumptions or premises are true, then their conclusions are true too. Logic also characterizes **correct** or **valid** forms of reasoning; that is sometimes done byf irst defining **incorrect** or **invalid** steps through counterexamples.

Logic is depply connected to mathematics and philosophy; correctness of arguementation is particularly crucial for these “abstract” subjects. 

The systemic presentation and investigation of logic began with Greek philosopher Aristotle. The subject is given a comprehensive exposition in Aristotle's Prior Analytics. 

One particular problem, called the decision problem, was raised. 

> The decision problem asks is there a mechanical procedure that makes it possible to determine with certainty in finitely many steps whether a formula in a particular logical language is or is not a logical consequence of certain assumptions.

David Hilbert emphasized its significance. He characterized it as the central problem of theoretical logic.

> "The Entscheidungsproblem is solved if one knows a procedure that allows one to decide the validity (respectively, satisfiability) of a given logical expression by a finite number of operations." - David Hilbert

If the decision problem had a positive answer, then the statements of mathematics can be expressed in an appropriate logical language, and that one starts mathematical proofs from just a finite number of axiomatic principles. Then, for any statement in the given language, the mechanical procedure would decide whether it is or is not a logical consequence of the axioms. That is, mathematics would be reduced to carrying out this mechanical procedure. 

John von Neumann took that as a reason for thinking that the decision problem must have a negative answer.

This problem led to the development of what is now known as the basis of Computer Science. The Theory of Computability.

Alan Turing came up with the Halting Problem, which was mathematically equivelant to the decision problem, showing that the decision problem did indeed have a negative solution.
