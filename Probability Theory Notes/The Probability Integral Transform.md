Suppose $F_{X}$ is a continuous CDF which is invertible $(\frac{dy}{dx}\ne 0,  \forall x\in \mathbb{R})$ over $\mathbb{R}$. Let $X\sim F_{X}$ and let $F_{X}^{-1}$ be the inverse of $F_{X}$. We have that:
$$ F_{X}(X)\sim U$$
and that 
$$F_{X}^{-1}(U)\sim F_{X}$$
The function $F_{X}^{-1}$ is called the quantile function of X
