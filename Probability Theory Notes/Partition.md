A colection of events $\{B_{1},..., B_{k}\}\subseteq S$ is called a *partition* of the sample space $S$ if it satisfies the following: 
$$S=B_{1}\cup ... \cup B_{k} \text{ with } B_{i\cap}B_{j}=\emptyset \text{ for all } i\ne j.$$
Note that $B_i$ doesn't have to be a simple event. Assuming the elemtsn of the partition have positive probability, we can write down the probability of any event in $S$ in terms of its conditional probabilities given the elemnts of the partition; this is the law of total probability.
