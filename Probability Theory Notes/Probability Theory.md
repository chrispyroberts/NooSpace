### What is Probability Theory?

Probability theory is the mathematical language for quantifying uncertainties and making quantitative assertions about random/stochastic events.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of topics that use probability theory:
- Life Sciences: Genetics, Medicine, Epidimeology
- Finance
- [[Queuing Theory]]
- [[Reliability Theory]]
- Public Policy
- Other branches of mathematics

### Example from High Energy Physics

In the 1960s, a phycisist named Peter Higgs with his collaberators theorized the existence of a sub-atomic particle which is responsible for the fact that physical objects have mass. This particle is called the [[Higgs Boson]]. 

Experimental physicists began a search for this particle by constructing the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The Higgs boson, if it were to exist, could be produced by a collision of high energy protons within the LHC.

In 2012, researchers at the LHC accounced that they discovered a new particle consistent with the Higgs boson.
