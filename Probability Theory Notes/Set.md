A *set* is an unordered collection of objects.
$$\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\} = \{7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1\}$$
Another way of expressing this set is the following:
$$\{i: i\text{ is an integer and } i\le i \le 6 \}$$
or
$$\{1\le i \le 6 : i \text{ is an integer}\}$$
When we want to talk about ordered collections of objects, we will prefer to use round brackets, and we will refer to them as **tuples**.
$$(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)\neq(6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1)$$
