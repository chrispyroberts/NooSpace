Given $n$ random variables $X_{1,}..., X_{n}$ we will say that they are independent if the events
$$\{X_{1}\in B_{1}\},...,\{X_{n}\in B_{n}\}$$
are independent for any $B_{1}, ..., B_{n}\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. That is to say that $X_{1}, ..., X_{n}$ is an independent sequence if the outcome of any element of the sequence does not depend on the outcomes of the others.
