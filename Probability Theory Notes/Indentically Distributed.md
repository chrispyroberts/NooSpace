We say that a collection of random variables $Y_{1}, ..., Y_{n}$ are identically distributed if they each have the same distribution.

i.e. $P_{Y_{i}}=P_{Y_{j}}$ for all $i, j$. 

This is equivalent to assuming $F_{Y_{i}}=F_{Y_{j}}$ for all $i,j$, which in turn is equivelant to assuming that $Y_{i}$ and $Y_{j}$ have the same PMF (in the discrete case) or PDF (in the continuous case) for all $i, j$.
