Both the exponential distribution and the geometric distribution measure the amount of time (or the number of trials) until the first occurance (or first success) is observed. Based on this connection, from the [[Memorylessness Properties of Geometric Distributions]], we also have the that exponential distribution is memoryless. 

It can be shown that any continuous memoryless distribution must be in the family of exponential distributions, in the same way that any discrete memoryless distribution must be in the family of geometric distributions. 

**Theorem:** [[Memorylessness Property of Exponential Distributions]]
Let $X\sim \text{Exp}(\beta)$. Then for all $a, b\gt 0:$
$$\mathbb{P}(X\gt a+b|X\gt a)=\mathbb{P}(X\gt b)$$
