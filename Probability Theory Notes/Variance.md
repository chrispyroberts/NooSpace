Let $X$ be a discrete or continuous random variable whose second moment exists. Then, its variance (or second central moment) is defined by
$$\text{Var}[X]=\mathbb{E}[(X-\mathbb{E}[X])^2]$$
Alternatively, the Variance can be expressed as follows:
$$\text{Var}[X]=E[X^2]-E[X]^2$$
The variance is a measure of spread or variability of the random variable $X$. It roughtly quantifies how much $X$ deviates from its center, on average.

It is important to note that the variance changes the units/scale of the problem as a result of squaring. The [[Standard Deviation]] fixes this problem by affixing a square root.
