**What is the difference between using a conclusion indicator and the position of a sentence to identify the conclusion in an argument?**
	Using an indicator expression is a more reliable conclusion indicator than the position of a sentence within the passage of text.
**What should one do when there aren't any conclusion indicators in an argument?**
	If there are no conclusion indicators in an argument, one should try to identify all the premises and see if all but one statement can be identified as premises, which means the one left will be the conclusion.
**What are some premise indicators?**
	Some premise indicators include "consider that", "take as evidence that", "it is evident that", "it is a (known) fact that", and "recall that".
