For an experiment to be considered binomial, it must satisfy the  following five proporties:
- The experiment consists of the repetition of $n$ trials, where $n$ is fixed.
- Each trial has two possible outcomes: $1$ (success) or $0$ (failure).
- The probability of success remains $p$ throughout the experiment.
- Each trial is [[Independent]] of the others
- The [[Random Variable]] of interest is $X$, the total number of successes in $n$ trials.
