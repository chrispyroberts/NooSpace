Let $X$ be a random variable which is discrete or continuous. Suppose that $X$ has a finite second moment, and let $\mu =\mathbb{E}[X]$ and $\sigma^{2}=\text{Var}[X]$. Then, for any constant $k>0,$
$$\mathbb{P}(|X-\mu| \ \lt k\sigma)=\mathbb{P}(-k\sigma \lt X-\mu \lt k\sigma)\ge \frac{1-1}{k^2}$$
Note that this inequality even holds for random variables whcih are neither discrete nor continuous. But one has to make sense of the expectation operator in that case, which we will not cover in this course.
