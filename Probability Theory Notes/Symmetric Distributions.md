Once we know the values of $\Phi(x)$ for $x\ge 0$, we also know them for all $x\lt0$, since the standard Gaussian PDF is symmetric around 0.

Suppose that $Y$ is a continuous random variable whose PDF $f_{Y}$ is an [[Even Function]] for all $y\in\mathbb{R}$. In this case, $Y$ has a symmetric distribution, and its CDF satisfies the relation:
$$F_{Y}(y)=1-F_{Y}(-y), \hspace{1cm} y\in\mathbb{R}$$
