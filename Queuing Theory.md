Queuing Theory is a mathematical study of waiting lines, also known as queues. It involves the analysis and optimization of the waiting time, length of queues, and service capacity in various scenarios where individuals or objects require services from limited resources. Queuing theory can be applied in various fields such as transportation, healthcare, telecommunications, and manufacturing to improve efficiency and customer satisfaction. It is used to predict how long customers will have to wait for service, how many servers are required to meet demand, and how to optimize the use of resources.
