- Each book covers a different area of mathematics
- The first four books focus on plane geometry 
- Book five introduces the theory of proportions 
- Book seven explores number theory 
- The final three books cover solid geometry 

Notes with Numbers/Data:
- Euclid's Elements was written around 300 BC

- Proposition 2.1: "To produce a finite straight line continuously in a straight line." 
- Proposition 7.17: "Prime numbers are more than any assigned multitude of prime numbers."
