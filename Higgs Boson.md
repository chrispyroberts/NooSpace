The Higgs boson is a subatomic particle that is believed to give mass to fundamental particles such as electrons and quarks. It was predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics and was discovered in 2012 by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments at CERN. The discovery of the Higgs boson confirmed a major prediction of the Standard Model and provided insight into the origin of mass in the universe.

The Higgs boson gives mass to fundamental particles through a process called electroweak symmetry breaking. According to the Standard Model of particle physics, the universe is filled with a field known as the Higgs field, which permeates all space. When particles interact with this field, they experience resistance, much like how objects moving through water experience drag. This resistance slows down the particles and gives them mass.

The Higgs boson is an elementary particle that is associated with the Higgs field. When it is created, it immediately decays into other particles, such as quarks or W and Z bosons. These particles then interact with the Higgs field and acquire mass.

The amount of mass that a particle acquires from the Higgs field depends on its interaction strength with the field. Particles that interact more strongly with the Higgs field will have more mass than those that interact less strongly. For example, electrons interact very weakly with the Higgs field and therefore have relatively low masses compared to other fundamental particles like top quarks.

In summary, the Higgs boson gives mass to fundamental particles by interacting with them through the Higgs field and slowing down their movement, resulting in their acquisition of mass.
